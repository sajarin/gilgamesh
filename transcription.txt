Perlmutter it's my 25th consecutive year Perlmutter loves the eighties I know what you're gonna say I'm not insane doctors are rarely indicted whoa he's just thinking your career but yeah I'm sure one of the doctors occasionally indicted I guess it could affect that someone needs to say what life is really like now for people who are dying what doctors have to go through the decisions we have to make alone without guidance someone should say that an unsigned letter to The Times I'd be telling the truth I'd be saying what we're all thinking who cares oncology department is subsidized by drug companies they don't want it run by murderer we're all murderers we just don't have the guts to it man once again who cares you won't be hireable anywhere if there's one thing I've learned from you it's that I should do what I think is right and not worry about the consequences yeah it's worked out great for me pretzel those are gonna show up on my credit card at seven bucks a bag there's an all-you-can-eat buffet downstairs studies show that $10 wine tastes better you're told that it got some $90 the same thing as the truth grape soda have one we could toast your pending unemployment yes you can sit here running up my hotel bill or you can go get the woman of your dreams I didn't know Angela Merkel was attending the conference I just spoke with Cuddy she doesn't think you're reliable and you will remain friend-zoned until that changes I can't convince Tripp I've changed my entire personality in a weekend yeah but you could make the first step what she need today a babysitter what are you thinking about fjords you see seriously I know this is out of your comfort zone but don't scheme don't just do the deed you tell me that I gotta sure I've changed and you act like you don't believe I can I can't convince my best friend I'm sorry and that's I didn't mean I didn't mean I didn't mean you drugged me she's better off without you words can hurt you know huh it's Foreman trying to update house but his phone's off house he's out here patients losing blood faster than we can transfuse Cameron didn't know online search found out kina travels with his dog were treated for Rickettsia oh no I supposed to be getting paper five minutes ago dr. Wilson has asked me to tender his apologies for his absence you'll be hearing my paper instead unfortunately it wasn't time to correct the program schedule euthanasia let's tell the truth we all do it we just don't talk about it we play the game use other words or we don't use any words at all nice phrasing hello uh I don't know what department I want I need pants patient s 55 year old man and stage lung cancer his pain was beyond the point or we could even pretend to treat it I showed him how to use the morphine pump I told him too much morphine would kill him but not to worry the machine only gives out so much to override it you need to enter a special code I went to the door and told the nurse the code is three to eight I said it loudly when he first came to my office I told him I'd be with him every step of the way but I left him alone at the end I broke that promise to cover my ass I failed I was wrong when I wrote that I have never given any less than my best I am incapable of turning away from a responsibility my friends take advantage of that fact far too often I know that I gave that man everything I could I know that he knew that too this is a burden no one should have to carry alone and this is a decision no one should make alone because frankly I don't trust all of you excuse me doctor not many people would have your courage Thank You dr.
